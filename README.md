# bbkbd
bbkbd is an on screen keyboad for touch screens.  It is designed for one purpose.  To run a keyboard and one other app.  That other app is usually a browser.  bbkbd is itself a simple window manager (WM).  It only functions as intended when run directly under X Windows with no other WM in between.
